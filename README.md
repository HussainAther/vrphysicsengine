# **VR Educational Physics Engine**

Welcome to the **VR Educational Physics Engine**! This engine is designed specifically for creating **interactive physics simulations** and **educational content** in a VR environment. It aims to make it easy for developers to build immersive educational games with built-in tools for real-time physics interactions, modular simulations, and progress tracking.

## **Overview**

The **VR Educational Physics Engine** provides a flexible framework for creating physics-based learning experiences. With built-in features like **node-based scripting**, **pre-configured physics modules**, and **multi-platform support**, this engine allows developers to focus on creating high-quality, interactive content without needing to build each component from scratch.

### **Features**

- **Real-Time Physics Simulation**: Core modules for gravity, force application, collision detection, and more, making it easy to simulate real-world physics in VR.
- **Modular Design**: Pre-built modules for common physics concepts (e.g., projectile motion, harmonic motion) that can be easily customized and expanded.
- **Node-Based Visual Scripting**: Designed to support visual scripting for interactions, making it accessible for non-technical team members.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Optimized for VR, desktop, and mobile, ensuring that simulations run smoothly on various devices.
- **Learning Analytics**: Track player interactions and progress to provide feedback and insights on learning outcomes.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up the VR Educational Physics Engine and begin creating physics-based educational content.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/VR-Educational-Physics-Engine.git
   cd VR-Educational-Physics-Engine
   ```

2. **Build the Core Engine**:
   - This engine uses **C++** for its core physics simulation. Use **CMake** to configure and compile the engine for your development environment.
   - Ensure you have **CMake** installed, then run:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

3. **Integration with Unity or Unreal**:
   - **Unity**: Open the `/unity` folder and follow the setup guide provided in `UnityIntegration.md` to import the engine as a Unity plugin.
   - **Unreal**: Open the `/unreal` folder and follow the setup guide in `UnrealIntegration.md` to add the engine as a plugin in Unreal Engine.

### **Basic Usage**

1. **Load an Example Project**:
   - Explore the example projects provided in the `/examples` folder for Unity and Unreal to see the engine in action.
   
2. **Configure Physics Parameters**:
   - Use the **node-based visual editor** or **scripting API** to modify key physics parameters (gravity, force, friction) in real time.
   
3. **Customize and Expand**:
   - The engine is modular, allowing you to add custom nodes, configure physics modules, or expand into new subjects as needed.
